# Evolving Words

Words are changing(mutating randomly) and populating to create the user defined ___beast___, the goal of the evolution.

Every contribution is welcome. 

It has just finished, needs optimization and handle different situations.

Usage:
  Start the main program (it does not take any arg)
  Write the _beast_ word as you wish but for now, just let _beast_ longer than 10 or 15 characters. It may take too long to finish
  After it finishes, you can see details of evolution in _history_, _ancestor_, ect.
These project is based on [Weasel program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program) in [The Blind Watchmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker)

_Methinks it is like a weasel_
